**Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
<br>
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of this program. To set up and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:
<br>
1) Install the Python 3 virtual environment package by running the following command:
<br>
```sudo apt install python3-venv```
<br>
2) Create a new virtual environment using the following command:
<br>
```python3 -m venv myenv```
<br>
3) Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
<br>
```source myenv/bin/activate```
<br>
4) Install dependencies
<br>
```pip install argparse requests colorama beautifulsoup4 feedparser python-Levenshtein```
<br>
*Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed with running the program without conflicting with other Python packages installed on your system.*
