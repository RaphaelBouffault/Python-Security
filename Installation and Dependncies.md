**Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of this program. To set up and activate a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1) Install the Python 3 virtual environment package by running the following command: 
<br>
sudo apt install python3-venv
<br>
<br>
2) Create a new virtual environment using the following command:
<br>
python3 -m venv myenv
<br>
<br>
3) Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
<br>
source myenv/bin/activate
<br>
<br>
4) Install dependencies:
<br>
pip install argparse requests colorama beautifulsoup4 feedparser python-Levenshtein
<br>
<br> 
*Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed with running the program without conflicting with other Python packages installed on your system.*
